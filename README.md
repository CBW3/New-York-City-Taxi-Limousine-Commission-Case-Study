I analyze NYC TLC data to perform exploratory data analysis & construct a regression model.

In particular, throughout this exercise, I cleaned, wrangled, and transformed the dataset to make it more usable for analysis.

Likewise, I produced visuals like box plots, correlation matrices, histograms, pairwise scatterplots, and other graphs to analyze the dataset. 

I also perform relevant statistical tests throughout this exercise as well as create a training & testing subset to improve model results.
